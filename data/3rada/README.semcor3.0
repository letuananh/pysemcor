SemCor 3.0 was automatically created from SemCor 1.6 by mapping 
WordNet 1.6 to WordNet 3.0 senses.
SemCor 1.6 was created and is property of Princeton University.

Some (few) word senses from WordNet 1.6 were dropped, and therefore 
they cannot be retrieved anymore in the 3.0 database. A sense of 0 
(wnsn=0) is used to symbolize a missing sense in WordNet 3.0.

The automatic mapping was performed within the Language and Information 
Technologies lab at UNT, by Rada Mihalcea (rada@cs.unt.edu).

THIS MAPPING IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND UNT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS 
OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.  BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT NOT 
LIMITATION, UNT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANT-
ABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Both LICENSE and README files distributed with the SemCor 1.6 package
are included in the current distribution of SemCor 3.0.

When the WordNet Semantic Concordance package is unbundled you should
have the following files and subdirectories in this directory:

	README.semcor3.0	this file
	LICENSE			WordNet copyright and license agreement
	INSTALL			INSTALL file for SemCor 1.6 
	brown1		103 semantically tagged Brown Corpus files
				(all content words tagged)
	brown2		83 semantically tagged Brown Corpus files
				(all content words tagged)
	brownv		166 semantically tagged Brown Corpus files
				(only verbs tagged)

Each semantic concordance directory (brown1, brown2, brownv) contains
the following subdirectories:
	tagfiles	directory of semantically tagged files

To access the files, unzip and untar the file semcor3.0.tar.gz.

For other files, such as documentation, taglists, etc., please check 
the SemCor 1.6 distribution (available from this site).
